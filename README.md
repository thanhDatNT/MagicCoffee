# MagicCoffee
This app was created with some basic components and logic. 
However, it can emulate a commercial app with essential functions such as login, register, making an order, deleting orders, viewing presenting products, and updating the profile.
I used some basic functions and libraries: notification, redux, camera, RESTful API, AsyncStorage and SQLite Database.
This app is still in the development process. Attempting to improve it more and more!
